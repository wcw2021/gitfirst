Section 3, Lecture 39
Greater than and less than are pretty straight forward in their use and meaning:

SELECT title
    ,release_year
FROM movies
WHERE release_year > 2005;   

Notice that Night at the Museum and National Treasure are not in the list.

SELECT title
    ,release_year
FROM movies
WHERE release_year > 2005
 AND  release_year < 2016; 

We can combine greater than and less than to limit to a specific range.

We can include the limits of the range using >= or <= (Greater Than or Equal To/Less Than or Equal To)
SELECT title
    ,release_year
FROM movies
WHERE release_year >= 2005
 AND  release_year <= 2016;  

While this is a great way to accomplish this, it’s also perfectly acceptable to use BETWEEN

SELECT title
    ,release_year
FROM movies
WHERE release_year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2016; 

Exact Same results that include 2005 and 2016 

Combination of both Greater Than and Less Than is <> which means Not Equal.  
SELECT title
      ,release_year
FROM movies
WHERE release_year <> 2016;  

Notice that the only value missing is the 2016

Not Equal also works well with other data types like strings.
SELECT title
      ,release_year
FROM movies
WHERE title <> 'Zoolander';   

Just like = and <>, we can use IN to include or exclude multiple values at the same time
SELECT title
      ,release_year
FROM movies
WHERE release_year IN (2005,2009,2010);   

In order to exclude items, we can use NOT IN
SELECT title
      ,release_year
FROM movies
WHERE release_year NOT IN (2005,2009,2010); 

This also works well for Strings
SELECT title
      ,release_year
FROM movies
WHERE title IN ('Zoolander','Tropic Thunder');
