Case statements - Text lecture
Section 3, Lecture 45
SELECT title
      ,rating
FROM movies;  

SELECT title
      ,rating
      ,CASE
         WHEN RATING = 'PG'    THEN 'Bring the Kids!'
         WHEN RATING = 'PG-13' THEN 'Older Kids'
         WHEN RATING = 'R'     THEN 'Not for Kids'
         ELSE 'No Information'
       END AS AUDIENCE
FROM movies;   
   
Case statements allow a lot of flexibility. They evaluate the first WHEN, and if it passes, it uses the THEN for the return value and skips to the next row.

Else option and allows for a catch-all value like No Information
The different 'whens' can be inspecting different values, and the CASE Statment can be used in the SELECT or the WHERE.  
Let revisit the NULL query from earlier.

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE CASE 
        WHEN rating IS NULL THEN 1
        WHEN rating = ''    THEN 1
        WHEN release_year <= 2007 THEN 1
      END = 1;
