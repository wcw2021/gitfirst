Dates and times - Text lecture
Section 3, Lecture 47
Some time functions:

SELECT NOW()
      ,CURDATE()
      ,CURTIME();

More information on time functons: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-functions.html

MySQL has prebuilt functions that offer some handy functionality when dealing with dates and times.

NOW() returns the system date and time of the server  
CURDATE() returns the system date without the time
CURTIME() returns the system time without the date

NOW() is useful for adding a timestamp when a row is being added to the database, but let’s use it to explore some other data functions 

SELECT NOW()
      ,CURDATE()
      ,CURTIME()
      ,YEAR(NOW())
      ,YEAR(CURDATE());

We can have just the year pulled out.  This function could easily be used to help group rows by years

SELECT NOW()
      ,MONTH(NOW())
      ,MONTHNAME(Now());

MySQL allows you to pull just the month by number or name

SELECT NOW()
      ,DAY(NOW())
      ,DAYNAME(Now())
      ,DAYOFMONTH(NOW())
      ,DAYOFWEEK(NOW())
      ,DAYOFYEAR(NOW());

DAY gives the day of the month
DAYNAME gives the name of the day of the week
DAYOFMONTH is the same as DAY
DAYOFWEEK gives the number corresponding to the day. Sunday is 1 and Saturday is 7
DAYOFYEAR gives the day if we were counting from Jan 1st as 1, 

You may have noticed that your cloud 9 Environment is not in your current timezone. Instead the System time is UTC. 
Find your timezone here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

Then you can set your timezone:
SET time_zone = '-7:00';
SET GLOBAL time_zone = '-7:00';

Then you can check the time difference:
select @@global.time_zone, @@session.time_zone;

You can then check your newly set time:
select NOW();
