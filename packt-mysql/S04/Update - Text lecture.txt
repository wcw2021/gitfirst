Update - Text lecture
Section 4, Lecture 53
In previous lectures we learned about select like below:

SELECT title
      ,release_year
FROM movies
WHERE release_year IS NULL;

If we want to update or change the data, we use UPDATE instead of select:
Use a select to find what to update
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE Title = 'Fight Club'; 

Then run an update on the same selection criteria:
UPDATE movies
SET ReleaseYear = 1999
WHERE Title = 'Fight Club'; 

We can update multiple rows and multiple columns at the same time:
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE title IN ('DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story'
               ,'Along Came Polly'
               ,'Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy');   

Rows matched:3 Changed:3
If you run this again, it will say matched: 3, Changed: 0

Use SELECT * to verify your WHERE before updating a table.
