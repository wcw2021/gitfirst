IMPORTANT: Development Environment Setup - Overview
Section 1, Lecture 4
To speed up setup and not run into installation issues we will use an online Integrated Development Environment instead of downloading software to our local machine. 

We will cloud9 which is an industry leader in online IDE's and comes pre-installed with everything we need to get started. However, they were purchased by AWS and may require a credit card on file to sign-up. While they don't charge anything (we'll use the free-tier), they keep a credit card on file for security reasons. If you want to skip the AWS sign-up procedure, you can request access to cloud9 from me. I have an instructor account with them and can send you a personal invitation link. This is a manual process and will involve you signing up for my newsletter with valid name, email address and Udemy username (so I can verify that you are a registered student in the course).
