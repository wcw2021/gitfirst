SELECT * FROM actors;

SELECT * FROM movies;

We will add lots of extra details but the SELECT * FROM is the general structure of how we retrieve any and all data from the database.

Listing the columns returns the same results as *

      ,FIRST_NAME
      ,LAST_NAME
FROM actors; 
  
SELECT FIRST_NAME
      ,LAST_NAME
