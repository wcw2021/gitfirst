Limit, order by and distinct - Text lecture
Section 2, Lecture 27
Large datasets where you don’t want to tax the system returning millions of rows use limit:

SELECT *
FROM actors
LIMIT 10; 

This query above will return the first 10 results from the actors table instead of all the rows.

Order by can be used to sort the data that is returned in the query result:
SELECT *
FROM actors
ORDER BY 3;

This query above will return the results sorted by the 3rd column of the table in ascending order by default

Which is the same as 
SELECT *
FROM actors
ORDER BY LAST_NAME ASC;

The ASC is for ascending which is implied.  The opposite is descending DESC

SELECT *
FROM actors
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

We can also sort by multiple columns at the same time and by name
SELECT *
FROM actors
ORDER BY LAST_NAME ASC, FIRST_NAME DESC;
Notice the order the Jerry and Ben are in.

And you can combine LIMIT and ORDER BY
SELECT *
FROM project1.actors
ORDER BY LAST_NAME ASC
        ,FIRST_NAME ASC
LIMIT 10;

DISTINCT 

Let's say you want to know all of the ratings for the movies 
SELECT RATING
FROM movies;

But don’t like the duplicate rows and want to only display unique ratings.
SELECT DISTINCT RATING
FROM movies;

Distinct only works when the whole row returned is unique. In the query below, because each movie has a unique ID, none of the rows are removed.
SELECT DISTINCT MovieID
               ,RATING
FROM movies;
