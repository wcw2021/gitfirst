Count, like and group by - Text lecture
Section 2, Lecture 29
Count can be used as follows:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM movies;

This will return the number of movies in the table

Try the following to get the number of movies for each rating and you'll get incorrect results:
SELECT RATING
      ,COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM movies;
*Incorrect Results

You can use GROUP BY (column name) to get correct results in such cases:
SELECT RATING
      ,COUNT(*) AS MOVIES
FROM movies
GROUP BY RATING;

Like is used all the time for search when an entire description is not known, it's used with a % -> LIKE %
SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE TITLE like 'Night at the Museum%';

Name the return columns with spaces using:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Night at the Museum Movies"
FROM movies
WHERE TITLE like 'Night at the Museum%';

You can put % before the word as well so like '%Museum%' and it will return all results that have museum in the title
