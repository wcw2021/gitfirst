Fix a bad join challenge - Text lecture
Section 5, Lecture 71
You have been given the following query to produce the selected columns but the join is not working correctly. Run the following query and then fix it:
SELECT A.FNAME
      ,A.dob
      ,B.Game1
      ,B.Game2
      ,B.Game3
      ,B.Game4
FROM Friends A
    ,bowlers B;

Solution:
Pick any join you want, but for my example, we will use INNER. Also, depending on which order you put the same fiends in, you can’t rely on the bowlerID and FriendID matching so I joined on names. If none of your friends and bowlers match up, insert a few friends that do.
SELECT A.FNAME
      ,A.dob
      ,B.Game1
      ,B.Game2
      ,B.Game3
      ,B.Game4
FROM Friends A
     INNER JOIN bowlers B
       ON A.FNAME = B.FNAME
       AND A.LNAME = B.LNAME;
