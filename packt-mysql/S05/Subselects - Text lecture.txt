Subselects - Text lecture
Section 5, Lecture 73
SQL allows queries inside of other quiries which can be extermely useful. Take our example from the previous lecture. If we want to know how many movies each director directed, a subselect can easily do the job.

SELECT A.FIRST_NAME
      ,A.LAST_NAME
      ,IFNULL(MIN(C.Release_Year),'N/A') AS FirstDirected
      ,IFNULL(MAX(B.Release_Year),'N/A') AS LatestRelease
      ,D.cnt AS MoviesDirected
FROM people A
     LEFT OUTER JOIN movies B
      ON B.director = A.ActorID
     LEFT OUTER JOIN movies C
      ON C.director = B.director   
     LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT Z.Director AS ActorID
                            ,COUNT(Z.MovieID) AS cnt
                      FROM movies Z
                      GROUP BY Z.Director) D
      ON D.ActorID = A.ActorID                      
GROUP BY A.FIRST_NAME
        ,A.LAST_NAME
        ,D.cnt
ORDER BY D.cnt DESC;

While there are performance hits from subselects in the SELECT section, it also is an option:
SELECT A.FIRST_NAME
      ,A.LAST_NAME
      ,IFNULL(MIN(C.Release_Year),'N/A') AS FirstDirected
      ,IFNULL(MAX(B.Release_Year),'N/A') AS LatestRelease
      ,(SELECT COUNT(Z.MovieID) 
        FROM movies Z
        WHERE Z.Director = A.ActorID) AS MoviesDirected
FROM people A
     LEFT OUTER JOIN movies B
      ON B.director = A.ActorID
     LEFT OUTER JOIN movies C
      ON C.director = B.director   
GROUP BY A.FIRST_NAME
        ,A.LAST_NAME
ORDER BY MoviesDirected DESC;
