Final Project Part 1 - Text solution
Section 5, Lecture 77
Challenge: Update with Joins

Objective: Alter the bowlers table to not keep the individual game scores.  Instead we will have a Running Average score (int) based on the results from bowlresults, ensure the names of the bowlers match in both tables (FNAME and LNAME)

You will need need some new functions for this: 
AVE() to pull the average of a grouped value 
ROUND() will round to an integer * use google to find and see examples of these functions

Step 1, drop the unneeded columns from bowlers table:
ALTER TABLE bowlers 
 DROP COLUMN Game1
,DROP COLUMN Game2
,DROP COLUMN Game3
,DROP COLUMN Game4;

Step 2: Add new column to bowlers:
ALTER TABLE bowlers
ADD COLUMN AveScore int DEFAULT NULL; 

Step 3: Plan the Update
SELECT A.FNAME
      ,A.LNAME
      ,AVG(B.Game_Score) AS RawAveScore
      ,ROUND(AVG(B.Game_Score)) AS AveScore
FROM  bowlers A
     ,bowlResults B
WHERE A.FNAME = B.FNAME
 AND  A.LNAME = B.LNAME
GROUP BY A.FNAME
        ,A.LNAME;    

Step 4: Create the update statement from the select

UPDATE bowlers A
SET AveScore = (SELECT ROUND(AVG(Game_Score)) AS AveScore
                FROM bowlResults B 
                WHERE B.FNAME = A.FNAME 
                 AND  B.LNAME = A.LNAME); 
SELECT * FROM bowlers;
