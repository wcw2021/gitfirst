Inner, Left, Outer and Right joins - Text lecture
Section 5, Lecture 67
Before we go any further with Joins, let's get the main types straight: INNER, LEFT OUTER, RIGHT OUTER and FULL OUTER.  

There are a few ways to specify these types in SQL, but for the purposes of this course, we will stick to these terms: LEFT OUTER JOIN is often called a LEFT JOIN, and an INNER JOIN may be referred to as a JOIN. A FULL OUTER JOIN can be called an OUTER JOIN. etc.

Imagine we have two tables:

Table A
 ColA
  1
  2
  3
  4

Table B 
 ColB
  3
  4
  5
  6

If we were to join these tables together, the number of rows returned would depend on the join we use. Notice 1 and 2 are unique to Table A, 5 and 6 are unique to table B. 3 and 4 are common to both tables.

SELECT *
FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.ColA = B.ColB;

This would return:
ColA | ColB
 3   |  3
 4   |  4
INNER JOIN requires that the value be on both tables

SELECT *
FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.ColA = B.ColB;

This would return:
ColA | ColB
 1   | NULL
 2   | NULL
 3   |  3
 4   |  4
LEFT OUTER JOIN returns everything from the first table (left) whether or not the second table has a corresponding row

SELECT *
FROM A RIGHT OUTER JOIN B ON A.ColA = B.ColB;

This would return:
ColA | ColB
 3   |  3
 4   |  4
 NULL|  5
 NULL|  6
RIGHT OUTER JOIN returns everything from the second table (right) whether or not the first table has a corresponding row

SELECT *
FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON A.ColA = B.ColB;

This would return:
ColA | ColB
 1   | NULL
 2   | NULL
 3   |  3
 4   |  4
 NULL|  5
 NULL|  6
FULL OUTER JOIN returns everything from both tables whether or not there are corresponding rows
